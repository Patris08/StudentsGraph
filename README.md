This Python script uses the Matplotlib library to create bar graphs to visualize the number of students in different classes for various subjects. The script includes three different bar graphs, demonstrating different aspects of data representation.

    Single Bar Graph for Class 1:
        The first part of the script creates a bar graph for Class 1 students in different subjects.
        Bar colors: Yellow
        Bar width: 0.2
        Bar style: ggplot
        X-axis: Classes
        Y-axis: Number of students in Class 1
        Title: BarGraph for Class 1 Students

    Multiple Bar Graphs for Classes 1, 2, and 3:
        The second part combines three bar graphs for Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3 students in different subjects.
        Bar colors: Yellow (Class 1), Green (Class 2), Black (Class 3)
        Bar width: 0.2
        X-axis: Classes
        Y-axis: Number of students in each class
        Title: BarGraph for Class 1, 2 & 3 Students

    Horizontal Bar Graph for Classes 1, 2, and 3:
        The third part creates a horizontal bar graph for Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3 students in different subjects.
        Bar colors: Yellow (Class 1), Green (Class 2), Black (Class 3)
        Bar width: 0.2
        Y-axis: Classes
        X-axis: Number of students in each class
        Title: BarGraph for Class 1, 2 & 3 Students

Note: The script uses the ggplot style, which can be changed to other available styles in Matplotlib. The data for each class and subject is predefined in the script. Users can modify the script to input their own data for visualization.
